# IrunfarReader

Welcome to the iRunFar Reader gem. This gem is a personal project that is part of Flatiron School's Community Powered Bootcamp. The iRunFar Reader gem pulls the most recent articles from iRunFar.com and allows you to select one to read.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'irunfar_reader'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install irunfar_reader

## Usage

The application shows a list of recent articles. Select the number of the one you would like to read. Then type "list" to show the list of articles again or "exit" to exit the application.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
